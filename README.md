## IBM Agentforce Client — Live Demo (NextBank)

This repository showcases the IBM Agentforce Client inside a realistic, end‑to‑end banking scenario. The fictional “NextBank” site exists purely to demonstrate how Agentforce can power intuitive, safe and productive user experiences.

### What is IBM Agentforce Client?

IBM Agentforce Client is a front‑end experience that lets users interact with AI agents in familiar, guided ways. It focuses on clarity, safety and task completion, with a UX designed for enterprise use cases.

### Why this demo exists

The NextBank interface is a narrative backdrop to highlight Agentforce’s value. Account cards, schedules, and market views are sample screens that make the agent’s capabilities tangible, without exposing any real services.

### What you can try here

- Conversational assistance that adapts to the current page context
- Guided actions for common tasks (e.g., finding information or navigating views)
- Safe data handling patterns for enterprise scenarios
- Dynamic UI responses to agent suggestions

All interactions are demonstration‑only and rely on mock or sample data.

### Demo highlights

- Clear hand‑offs between the user and the agent, so people stay in control
- Focused prompts and responses that minimize friction and cognitive load
- Non‑intrusive guidance layered into a standard web app layout

### Data and privacy

This demo uses synthetic data and is not connected to any real banking systems. It is intended solely for evaluation and learning.

### About the NextBank UI

The dashboard, calendar and stocks areas are illustrative surfaces to show how Agentforce augments typical workflows. They provide enough context to explore agent interactions without requiring real accounts.
