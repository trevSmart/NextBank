"But what if Elizabeth wants to ask about a different transaction, like the one from Ikea? Instead of typing out all the details, watch what she does next.

(L'Elizabeth mou el cursor i fa clic a la línia de la transacció de l'Ikea a la pàgina. La línia es ressalta visualment.)

She simply clicks on the transaction right on the page. This is the power of the Agentforce Web Client. It allows users to select any marked element on the page to provide precise, unambiguous context to their questions.

And here's the most remarkable part: This powerful interactivity is enabled without altering the original website's code. The only step required is to mark which elements should be context-aware. Our Web Client intelligently handles the rest, extracting the relevant data and passing it to the assistant.

(La resposta de l'assistent canvia immediatament, mostrant ara els detalls correctes de la transacció de l'Ikea que l'Elizabeth ha seleccionat.)

Notice how the assistant's response instantly adapts. It now understands that Elizabeth is specifically asking about the €133.75 charge from Ikea, and provides the correct details.

This eliminates ambiguity and streamlines the conversation, turning a potentially frustrating interaction into a quick and efficient one. The Agentforce Web Client transforms your entire webpage into a dynamic, interactive surface, empowering users and resolving issues faster than ever before."

It's designed to unlock the full potential of Agentforce, moving beyond simple Q&A to true, proactive partnership.
So, what does that mean in practice? Let's break down the key problems it solves. A standard chat UI only appears when the user clicks a button. The Web Client is embedded and always present. A standard UI only reacts to user prompts. The Web Client can proactively start conversations.
Most critically, a  standard UI is isolated from the page. The Web Client is fully context-aware and page-integrated, enabling a level of interaction that was previously impossible. It also allows for complete custom styling, ensuring the assistant feels native to your brand, not like a third-party add-on.
To illustrate these powerful capabilities, we've created the NextBank demo site. Here, we'll follow a customer, Elizabeth, as she deals with a common but stressful issue: potential credit card fraud. Pay close attention to how the Agentforce Web Client transforms this journey.
Elizabeth has just received a fraud alert. As she logs into her account, notice the first major differentiator: proactive engagement. The assistant doesn't wait for her to ask for help. Because it's always listening and integrated with backend business triggers, it initiates the conversation immediately, providing crucial information upfront.
It says: "We blocked a suspicious transaction...and temporarily locked your card for security... Want to go through it together now?" This proactive approach immediately reduces customer anxiety and shows that the bank is already on top of the situation. This is a level of service a standard, reactive chatbot simply cannot provide.
Now, watch closely. This is where context-aware, bidirectional interaction comes to life. As Elizabeth agrees, the assistant doesn't just list the details in the chat window. It dynamically highlights both the affected card and the specific fraudulent transaction on the page. It's actively guiding her focus, making the process intuitive and error-proof. The assistant isn't just in a box; it's interacting with the entire webpage.
The conversation continues to demonstrate this deep contextual understanding. Elizabeth isn't sure and asks, "Are there any other operations at the same store?" Because the Web Client gives Agentforce full access to page data and user history, it can instantly retrieve and display the relevant transactions, helping her confirm the fraud without ever leaving the flow.
Now that the fraud is confirmed, the assistant proposes a clear, multi-step resolution plan. But the journey remains dynamic. Elizabeth asks if she needs to report this to the authorities. Agentforce understands this new requirement and adapts the workflow on the fly, adding a new step and offering to draft the official report email for her. This is complex task automation, made simple through conversation.
With a single command, Agentforce composes a complete, pre-filled email, ready for her review. This demonstrates the "Seamless Integration" capability—it's not just talking, it's doing. All Elizabeth has to do is provide the recipient's email address.
The report is sent, and a copy is forwarded to Elizabeth for her records. The entire, complex issue—from detection to resolution and reporting—has been handled in minutes, within a single, guided, and reassuring experience.
What you've just seen is the transformation from a reactive tool to a proactive digital partner. The IBM Agentforce Web Client turns every webpage into an interactive, intelligent surface, making complex customer journeys seamless, intuitive, and remarkably efficient. It'''s not just a better chatbot; it's the future of digital customer interaction.
